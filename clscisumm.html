        <h1>The 6<sup>th</sup> Computational Linguistics Scientific Document Summarization Shared
          Task (CL-SciSumm 2020)</h1>

        <h2>Call for Participation</h2>

        <p>
          CL-SciSumm is the first medium-scale shared task on scientific document summarization, with over 500 annotated
          documents. <a href="https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cl-scisumm2019/">Last year's CL-SciSumm shared task</a>
          introduced large scale training datasets, both annotated from ScisummNet and auto-annotated. For the task,
          Systems were provided with a Reference Paper (RP) and 10 or more Citing Papers (CPs) that all contain
          citations to the RP, which they used to summarise RP. This was evaluated against abstract and human written
          summaries on ROUGE. The shared task attracted 17 registrations and 9 final system submissions. This year,
          CL-SciSumm '20 will have two new tracks: <b><a href="#laysumm">LaySumm</a></b> and <b><a
              href="#longsumm">LongSumm</a></b>.
        </p>

        <hr class="featurette-divider">

        <!-- TASKS ======================================================== -->

        <h2>Tasks</h2>

        <h3>CL-SciSumm</h3>

        <h4>Given</h4>

        <p>
          A topic consisting of a Reference Paper (RP) and Citing Papers (CPs) that all contain citations to the RP. In
          each CP, the text spans (i.e., citances) have been identified that pertain to a particular citation to the RP.
        </p>

        <h4>Task 1A</h4>

        <p>
          For each citance, identify the spans of text (cited text spans) in the RP that most accurately reflect the
          citance. These are of the granularity of a sentence fragment, a full sentence, or several consecutive
          sentences (no more than 5).
        </p>

        <h4>Task 1B</h4>

        <p>
          For each cited text span, identify what facet of the paper it belongs to, from a predefined set of facets.
        </p>

        <h4>Task 2 (optional bonus task)</h4>

        <p>
          Finally, generate a structured summary of the RP from the cited text spans of the RP. The length of the
          summary should not exceed 250 words.
        </p>

        <h4>Evaluation</h4>

        <p>
          Task 1 will be scored by overlap of text spans measured by number of sentences in the system output vs the
          gold standard created by human annotators. Task 2 will be scored using the ROUGE family of metrics between (i)
          the system output and the gold standard summary from the reference spans (ii) the system output and the
          asbtract of the reference paper.
        </p>

        <h3 id="laysumm">LaySumm</h3>

        <p>
          To ensure and increase the relevance of science for all of society and not just a small group of niche
          practitioners, researchers have been increasingly tasked by funders and publishers to outline the scope of
          their research for a general public by writing a summary for a lay audience, or lay summary. The LaySumm
          summarization task considers automating this responsibility, by enabling systems to automatically generate lay
          summaries. A lay summary explains, succinctly and without using technical jargon, what the overall scope, goal
          and potential impact of a scientific paper is.
        </p>

        <p>
          The corpus for this task will comprise full-text papers with lay summaries, in a variety of domains, and from
          a number of journals. Elsevier will make a collection of about 500 Lay Summaries available which are available
          in Open Access from a collection of journals, as well as the abstracts and full text of these journals.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Task will be to generate summaries that are representative of the content, comprehensible, and interesting
          to a lay audience. The intrinsic evaluation will be done by ROUGE. In addition, a subset of randomly selected
          summaries will undergo human evaluation by science journalists and communicators for comprehensiveness,
          legibility and interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          All nominated entries will be invited to publish a paper in Open Access (Author-Payment Charges will be
          waived) in a selected Elsevier publication. Authors will be asked to provide an automatically generated lay
          summary of their paper, together with their contribution.
        </p>

        <h3 id="longsumm">LongSumm</h3>

        <p>
          The LongSumm Task focuses on generating long summaries of scientific articles which require expertise in a
          scientific domain. To this end, we created a training set that consists of 1705 extractive summaries, and 200
          abstractive summaries of NLP and Machine Learning scientific papers. These are drawn from papers based on
          video talks from associated conferences (TalkSumm) and from blogs created by NLP and ML researchers. In
          addition, we create a test set of 30 abstractive summaries. Each submission is judged against one reference
          summary (gold summary) on ROUGE and should not exceed 600 words.
        </p>
