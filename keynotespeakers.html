        <p class="lead">Managing Director, MSR Outreach Academic Services, USA</p>
        <p>Kuansan Wang is a Principal Researcher and Managing Director of Microsoft Research Outreach where
          he is responsible for engaging with the global academic community on jointly advancing the state-ofthe-
          art in the areas MSR conducts research. He is leading a team that conducts research on web-scale
          machine reading, intelligent inference, deep semantic analytics and user behavior modeling. In addition
          to contributing to the development of Microsoft Bing and Cortana, the technologies developed at his team
          can also be seen in Microsoft Academic services that include a search engine at academic.microsoft.com
          and the Academic Knowledge API available through Microsoft Cognitive Services. Dr. Wang joined MSR
          in 1998 as a researcher in speech technology group where he conducted research in language modeling
          and multimodal interactions. He then became a software architect for Microsoft speech product group,
          responsible for Microsoft Speech Server and Response Point, and represented Microsoft to W3C, ECMA
          and ISO to help author international standards in speech, language and communication areas. He returned
          to MSR to work on web search in 2007 and has been a key driving force to evolve web search from a
          keyword based to semantic based paradigm. Kuansan received his BS from National Taiwan University
          and MS and PhD as an NSF Fellow from University of Maryland, College Park, all in electrical engineering.

        <p>
		With the broad adoption of evidence based decision making processes, recent years have witnessed more frequent examples
		where biases in the datasets or the analytical algorithms lead to unfortunate and sometimes harmful outcomes. 
		Being mindful of potential biases and actively taking measures to mitigate them have become a necessary second nature 
		for scholars and decision makers alike. Citations in scholarly publications have long been known to represent the crowd-sourced 
		collective judgments on scholarly communications and can be a valuable source of information in analyzing scholarly documents. 
		This study describes a methodology that uses citations to identify biases in such corpus, using as an example the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, 
		or CORD-19, a corpus created to advance the development of intelligent technologies that can assist scientists in navigating through the 
		voluminous literature of COVID-19. By expanding to articles in the citation networks seeded by CORD-19 with three distinct algorithms, 
		it can be shown that CORD-19 has a strong tilt in favor of recent articles and uneven coverages in the topical fields and the publication venues. 
		Using CORD-19 to identify critical knowledge and assess the journal importance, for example, will lead to different conclusions from the 
		analyses based on the three expanded datasets, of which results largely agree with one another. CORD-19, however, does not appear to exhibit biases
		in describing research collaborations in terms of team sizes or geolocations. Currently, the three citation network traversal algorithms 
		only utilize bibliographic records. How improvements can be made to them, such as through more sophisticated uses of citation contexts, 
		will also be discussed.

	 <p class="lead">Keynote Title: <em> The future of arXiv and knowledge discovery in open science </em> </p>
        <p>arXiv, the preprint server for the physical and mathematical sciences, is in its third decade of operation. 
As the flow of new, open access research increases inexorably, the challenges to keep up with and discover 
research content also become greater.   I will discuss the status and future of arXiv, and possibilities
and plans to make more effective use of the research database to enhance ongoing research efforts.
