        <!-- CALL FOR PAPERS ============================================= -->
         <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
        <p>You are invited to participate in the 1st Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing (SDP 2020) to be held 
          in conjunction with the 2020 Conference in Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2020) 
          on November 11 or 12 in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. </p>
          
          <p> The workshop will consist of a research track and 
          a shared task track. The shared task track includes the  
          <a href="https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus"> 6th edition of the CL-SciSumm shared task</a> and 
          two new summarization tasks -- CL-LaySumm and LongSumm -- geared 
          towards easier access to scientific methods and results. </p>
          
           <p>The tentative submission deadline is July 15, 2020.</p>
          
           <p> SDP is a continuation of the <a href="https://philippmayr.github.io/BIRNDL-WS/">BIRNDL</a> 
             and the <a href="https://wosp.core.ac.uk/">WOSP</a> workshop series. </p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>In addition to the long-standing challenge faced by scholars of keeping up with the growing literature in their own and related fields, they must now compete with malign pseudo-science and dis-information in informing public policy and behavior. This has stimulated workshops and research focused on enhancing search, retrieval, summarization, and analysis of scholarly documents. However, the general research community on scholarly document processing remains fragmented, and efforts towards natural language understanding of scholarly text that is central to vastly improve all the said downstream applications are not widespread. </p>
        <p>To address these gaps, we, the organizers of BIRNDL and WOSP workshops, propose the first Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing. We seek to reach to the broader NLP and AI/ML community to pool the distributed efforts to improve scholarly document understanding and enable intelligent access to the published research. The goal of SDP is two-fold: to increase collaboration between communities interested in leveraging knowledge stored in scientific literature and data and to establish SDP as the single-focused 
          primary venue for the field.</p>
        <p>We seek to appeal to the mainstream NLP and ML community working on SDP tasks – which are NLP tasks – to publish at SDP as we seek to establish SDP as the integrated premier venue. We have established a steering committee to help us turn SDP into a conference in the forthcoming years.</p>

          In addition to the long-standing challenge faced by scholars of keeping up with the growing literature in
          their own and related fields, they must now compete with malign pseudo-science and dis-information in
          informing public policy and behavior. This has stimulated workshops and research focused on enhancing search,
          retrieval, summarization, and analysis of scholarly documents. However, the general research community on
          scholarly document processing remains fragmented, and efforts towards natural language understanding of
          scholarly text that is central to vastly improve all the said downstream applications are not widespread. To
          address these gaps, we, organizers of <a href="previousworkshops.html">BIRNDL and WOSP workshops</a>, propose
          the 1<sup>st</sup> Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing. We seek to reach to the broader NLP and AI/ML
          community to pool the distributed efforts to improve scholarly document understanding and enable intelligent
          access to the published research. SDP will comprise a research track and the
          <a href="sharedtasks.html">6<sup>th</sup> CL-SciSumm Shared Task</a> with new tasks geared towards easier
          access to scientific methods and results.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past several years and at various venues, the <a
            href="https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~birndl2019/">Joint
            Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced IR and NLP for Digital Libraries</a> (<b>BIRNDL</b>) and the
          <a href="https://wosp.core.ac.uk/">International Workshop on Mining Scientific Publications</a>
          (<b>WOSP</b>) have established themselves as the principal venues for scholarly
          document processing (SDP) research. Various research groups and various workshops have focused separately on
          different problems of and approaches to SDP. However, an integrated focus is past due. We believe that natural
          language processing is central to SDP, but that workshops at non-NLP venues have ignored its centrality. As
          such, we believe that SDP will be strengthened by being hosted at an ACL venue.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of SDP is two fold: to increase collaboration between communities interested in leveraging knowledge
          stored in scientific literature and data and to establish SDP as the single focused primary venue for the
          field. We expect this workshop to hasten knowledge transfer, provide a common forum for
          comparing different solutions to shared problems, and facilitate discussions converging towards solutions to
          open problems in SDP. We seek to appeal to the mainstream NLP and ML community working on SDP tasks &ndash;
          which
          are NLP tasks &ndash; to publish at SDP as we seek to establish SDP as the integrated premier venue. We have
          established a steering committee to help us turn SDP into a conference in the forthcoming years.
