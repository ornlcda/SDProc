        <p>
          In addition to the long-standing challenge faced by scholars of keeping up with the growing literature in
          their own and related fields, they must now compete with malign pseudo-science and dis-information in
          informing public policy and behavior. This has stimulated workshops and research focused on enhancing search,
          retrieval, summarization, and analysis of scholarly documents. However, the general research community on
          scholarly document processing remains fragmented, and efforts towards natural language understanding of
          scholarly text that is central to vastly improve all the said downstream applications are not widespread. To
          address these gaps, we, organizers of BIRNDL and WOSP workshops, propose the 1<sup>st</sup> Workshop on
          Scholarly Document Processing. We seek to reach to the broader NLP and AI/ML community to pool the distributed
          efforts to improve scholarly document understanding and enable intelligent access to the published research.
          SDP will comprise a research track and the 6\textsuperscript{th} CL-SciSumm Shared Task with new tasks geared
          towards easier access to scientific methods and results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past several years and at various venues, the Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced IR and NLP for
          Digital Libraries (<b>BIRNDL</b>) and the <a href="https://wosp.core.ac.uk/">International Workshop on Mining
            Scientific Publications</a> (<b>WOSP</b>) have established themselves as the principal venues for scholarly
          document processing (SDP) research. Various research groups and various workshops have focused separately on
          different problems of and approaches to SDP. However, an integrated focus is past due. We believe that natural
          language processing is central to SDP, but that workshops at non-NLP venues have ignored its centrality. As
          such, we believe that SDP will be strengthened by being hosted at an ACL venue.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of SDP is two fold: to increase collaboration between communities interested in leveraging knowledge
          stored in scientific literature and data and to establish SDP as the single focused primary venue for the
          field. We expect this workshop to %enable faster hasten knowledge transfer, provide a common forum for
          comparing different solutions to shared problems, and facilitate discussions converging towards solutions to
          open problems in SDP. We seek to appeal to the mainstream NLP and ML community working on SDP tasks -- which
          are NLP tasks -- to publish at SDP as we seek to establish SDP as the integrated premier venue. We have
          established a steering committee to help us turn SDP into a conference in the forthcoming years.
        </p>

        <h3>Topics of interest</h3>

        <p>
          The topics of interest to SDP are purposely designed to encompass all approaches to mining scholarly data, to
          encourage submissions from all relevant communities. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
        </p>

        <ul class="topics-list">
          <li>Information extraction, text mining and parsing of scholarly literature</li>
          <li>Reproducibility and peer review</li>
          <li>Lay Summarization (i.e., summaries created for non-experts) of individual and collections of scholarly
            documents</li>
          <li>Discourse modeling and argument mining; (5) Summarization and question-answering for scholarly documents
          </li>
          <li>Semantic and network-based indexing, search and navigation in structured text</li>
          <li>Graph analysis/mining including citation and co-authorship networks</li>
          <li>New scholarly language resources and evaluation</li>
          <li>Connecting and interlinking publications, data, tweets, blogs or their parts</li>
          <li>Disambiguation, metadata extraction, enrichment, and data quality assurance for scholarly documents</li>
          <li>Bibliometrics, scientometrics, and altmetrics approaches and applications</li>
          <li>Other aspects of scientific workflows including open access/science, and research assessment</li>
          <li>Infrastructures for accessing scientific publications and/or research data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Overall, the workshop looks forward to all novel research involved in the mining of scholarly artefacts.
        </p>

        <h3>Submission information</h3>

        <p>
          Authors are invited to submit short and full papers with unpublished, original work. Submissions will be
          subject to a double blind peer review process. Accepted papers will be presented by the authors at the
          workshop either as a talk or a poster. All accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.
        </p>

        <p>
          The submissions should be in PDF format and anonymized for review. All submissions must be written in English
          and follow the <a href="https://acl2020.org/calls/papers/#formatting-requirements">ACL 2020 formatting
            requirements</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Long paper submissions:</b> up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited references.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Short paper submissions:</b> up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references.
        </p>

        <p>
          Final versions of accepted papers will be allowed 1 additional page of content so that reviewer comments can
          be taken into account.
