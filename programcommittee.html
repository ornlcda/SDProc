          <p>Derek Murray is a senior software engineer in the Google Brain team, currently building the TensorFlow system for large-scale machine learning. His principal research interest is distributed systems for parallel computation, with a particular emphasis on expressive programming constructs like streaming and iteration. Previously he was a researcher at Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, where he worked on the Naiad system for incremental, iterative, and interactive processing. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, his MSc in High Performance Computing from the University of Edinburgh, and his BSc from the University of Glasgow.</p>

          <p class="lead">Los Alamos National Laboratory</p>
          <p>Reid Porter is a research scientist in the Computing, Computational and Statistical Sciences Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Reid obtained a doctorate in electrical engineering from the Queensland University of Technology, Australia, in 2002. Reid's thesis work focused on using reconfigurable computing to accelerate learning and inference in convolutional neural networks for satellite image analysis, and highlights his early interest at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and computer architecture. Reid's interest in these topics has continued to grow while working on a variety projects at Los Alamos. He has more recently contributed theory, algorithms and software for interactive machine learning systems to better support domain experts in specialized science and defense applications. From 2015 to 2018 Reid was a technical leader in Computer Vision at Kitware Inc. where he focused on moving object detection, tracking and activity detection in video and wide area motion imagery.</p>
