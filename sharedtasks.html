        <h2 id="clscisumm">CL-SciSumm 2020: The 6<sup>th</sup> Computational Linguistics Scientific Document Summarization Shared Task</h2>

        <p>
          CL-SciSumm is the first medium-scale shared task on scientific document summarization, with over 500 annotated
          documents. <a href="https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cl-scisumm2019/">Last year's CL-SciSumm shared task</a>
          introduced large scale training datasets, both annotated from ScisummNet and auto-annotated. For the task,
          Systems were provided with a Reference Paper (RP) and 10 or more Citing Papers (CPs) that all contain
          citations to the RP, which they used to summarise RP. This was evaluated against abstract and human written
          summaries on ROUGE. The shared task attracted 17 registrations and 9 final system submissions. This year,
          CL-SciSumm '20 will have two new tracks: <b><a href="#laysumm">LaySumm</a></b> and <b><a
              href="#longsumm">LongSumm</a></b>.
        </p>

        <h3>CL-SciSumm Task</h3>

        <p>
          The task is defined as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Given:</strong> A topic consisting of a Reference Paper (RP) and Citing Papers (CPs) that all contain citations to the RP. In each CP, the text spans (i.e., citances) have been identified that pertain to a particular citation to the RP.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Task 1A:</strong> For each citance, identify the spans of text (cited text spans) in the RP that most accurately reflect the citance. These are of the granularity of a sentence fragment, a full sentence, or several consecutive sentences (no more than 5).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Task 1B:</strong> For each cited text span, identify what facet of the paper it belongs to, from a predefined set of facets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Task 2 (optional bonus task):</strong> Finally, generate a structured summary of the RP from the cited text spans of the RP. The length of the summary should not exceed 250 words.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Evaluation</h4>

        <p>
          Task 1 will be scored by overlap of text spans measured by number of sentences in the system output vs the
          gold standard created by human annotators. Task 2 will be scored using the ROUGE family of metrics between (i)
          the system output and the gold standard summary from the reference spans (ii) the system output and the
          asbtract of the reference paper.
        </p>

        <!-- LaySumm ========================================================= -->

        <h2 id="laysumm">CL-LaySumm 2020: The 1<sup>st</sup> Computational Linguistics Lay Summary Challenge Shared Task</h2>

        <p>
          To ensure and increase the relevance of science for all of society and not just a small group of niche
          practitioners, researchers have been increasingly tasked by funders and publishers to outline the scope of
          their research for a general public by writing a summary for a lay audience, or lay summary. The LaySumm
          summarization task considers automating this responsibility, by enabling systems to automatically generate lay
          summaries. 
          <!-- A lay summary explains, succinctly and without using technical jargon, what the overall scope, goal and potential impact of a scientific paper is. -->
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          The corpus for this task will comprise full-text papers with lay summaries, in a variety of domains, and from
          a number of journals. Elsevier will make a collection of about 500 Lay Summaries available from a collection of journals, as well as the abstracts and full text of these journals.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          The CL-LaySumm Shared Task is to automatically produce Lay Summaries of technical (scientific research article) texts. A Lay Summary is defined as a textual summary intended for a non-technical audience. It is typically produced either by the authors or by a journalist or commentator. Examples are provided in the training data. The corpus will cover three distinct domains: epilepsy, archeology, and materials engineering.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          The Task will be to generate summaries that are representative of the content, comprehensible, and interesting
          to a lay audience. The intrinsic evaluation will be done by ROUGE. In addition, a subset of randomly selected
          summaries will undergo human evaluation by science journalists and communicators for comprehensiveness,
          legibility and interest.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          In more detail, a lay summary explains, succinctly and without using technical jargon, what the overall scope, goal and potential impact of a scientific paper is. It is typically about 70 - 100 words in length. The task is to generate summaries that are representative of the content, comprehensible, and interesting to a lay audience.
        </p>

        <p>
          The intrinsic evaluation will be done by ROUGE, using ROUGE-1, -2, and Skipgram metrics. In addition, a randomly selected subset of the summaries will undergo human evaluation by science journalists and communicators for comprehensiveness, legibility, and interest.
        </p>

        <p>
          All nominated entries will be invited to publish a paper in Open Access (Author-Payment Charges will be waived) in a selected Elsevier publication. Authors will be asked to provide an automatically generated lay summary of their paper, together with their contribution.
        </p>

        <h3>Lay Summary Task</h3>

        <p>
          The task is defined as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Given:</strong> A full-text paper, its Abstract, and a Lay Summary of a given paper
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Task:</strong> For each paper, generate a Lay Summary of the specified length
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Evaluation</h4>

        <p>
          The Lay Summary Task will be scored by using several ROUGE metrics to compare the system output and the gold standard Lay Summary. As a follow-up to the intrinsic evaluation, we will crowdsource a number of automatically generated lay summaries to a panel of judges and a lay audience. Details of the crowdsourcing evaluation will be announced with the sharing of the final test corpus on July 15, 2020.
        </p>

        <h3>Corpus</h3>

        <p>
          The corpus for this task will comprise full-text papers with lay summaries, in a variety of domains, and from a number of journals. Elsevier will make available a collection of lay summaries from a multidisciplinary collection of journals, as well as the abstracts and full text of these journals. For a small sample dataset, see the task <a href="https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus/blob/master/README_Laysumm.md#sample-dataset">GitHub repository</a>.

        <!-- LongSumm ========================================================= -->

        <h2 id="longsumm">LongSumm 2020: Shared Task on Generating Long Summaries for Scientific Documents</h2>

        <!-- <p>
          The LongSumm Task focuses on generating long summaries of scientific articles which require expertise in a
          scientific domain. To this end, we created a training set that consists of 1705 extractive summaries, and 200
          abstractive summaries of NLP and Machine Learning scientific papers. These are drawn from papers based on
          video talks from associated conferences (TalkSumm) and from blogs created by NLP and ML researchers. In
          addition, we create a test set of 30 abstractive summaries. Each submission is judged against one reference
          summary (gold summary) on ROUGE and should not exceed 600 words.
        </p> -->

        <p>
          Most of the work on scientific document summarization focuses on generating relatively short summaries (abstract like). While such a length constraint can be sufficient for summarizing news articles, it is far from sufficient for summarizing scientific work. In fact, such a short summary resembles more to an abstract than to a summary that aims to cover all the salient information conveyed in a given text. Writing such summaries requires expertise and a deep understanding in a scientific domain, as can be found in some researchers blogs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The LongSumm task opted to leverage blogs created by researchers in the NLP and Machine learning communities and use these summaries as reference summaries to compare the submissions against.
        </p>

        <p>
          The corpus for this task includes a training set that consists of 1,705 extractive summaries, and around 700 abstractive summaries of NLP and Machine Learning scientific papers. These are drawn from papers based on video talks from associated conferences (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01351">Lev et al. 2019 TalkSumm</a>) and from blogs created by NLP and ML researchers. In addition, we create a test set of abstractive summaries. Each submission is judged against one reference summary (gold summary) on ROUGE and should not exceed 600 words.
        </p>

        <h3>Long Summary Task</h3>

        <p>
          The task is defined as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Given:</strong> For a detailed description of the provided data, please see the <a href="https://github.com/guyfe/LongSumm#training-data">LongSumm GitHub repository</a>

            <strong>Task:</strong> Generate abstractive and extractive summaries for scientific papers
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Evaluation</h4>

        <p>
          The Long Summary Task will be scored by using several ROUGE metrics to compare the system output and the gold standard Lay Summary. The intrinsic evaluation will be done by ROUGE, using ROUGE-1, -2, -L and Skipgram metrics. In addition, a randomly selected subset of the summaries will undergo human evaluation.
        </p>

        <h3>Corpus</h3>

        <p>
